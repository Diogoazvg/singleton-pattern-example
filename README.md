# 🚀 Ruby Code Challenges Repository For Singleton Pattern

## Overview:

Explore a collection of diverse and well-commented Ruby code challenges, showcasing problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and proficiency in Ruby programming.

## Highlights:

- **Classic Singleton Pattern:**
In this example, the SingletonClass has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation. The instance class method
is used to create and return the single instance of the class. Subsequent calls to instance return the same instance.

- **Module-based Singleton Pattern:**
In this example, the Singleton pattern is implemented using a module. The SingletonModule module has a private
constructor, and the instance method is used to create and return the single instance of the module. Subsequent calls to
instance return the same instance.
